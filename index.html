    <h3>What is a Shell?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      A shell is a User Interface (UI) that allows users to interact with their computer with few layers of abstraction (almost directly to the OS). The shell that we are most familiar with, and is one of the most popular is called BASH (Bourne Again SHell). Another example is the Windows Command Prompt. Generally shells are text based in order to prevent unneeded features slowing down processes.

    <h3>What is a shell script? (And why should anyone care about them?)</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      A shell script is any program designed to be run directly by a shell. They are easy to write, run without the need for an additional compiler or interpreter and can drastically increase the functionality of your shell. They are most useful because they require no additional software, and with a little effort to learn, you can save a great deal of time doing simple tasks in the future (think how much time keyboard shortcuts save). Also they make you look like a terminal pro!

    <h3>And Now for Your First Shellscript!</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      As is customary with learning any new language, this walkthrough will take you through the process of writing and running your very first Shellscript as a "Hello World!" program. Then we'll progress into some more basics of Shell! Okay? Okay! :)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>
      To start off, any Shell code must begin with the following line:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
	#! /bin/bash
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      This is to indicate to your computer that when you run this file as an executable, the program that will be used to run your code will be bash, whose path you just provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      So every Shell file you ever write will pretty much follow this format:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
	#! /bin/bash
	# A BUNCH OF TERMINAL COMMANDS
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      At heart, that's essentially all that it is! You feed bash a bunch of stuff to do, and then it does it! You can have your commands be anything, including, ls, cd, mv, rm, cp, mkdir, touch, or git commit -m "This commit doesn't work." But to start, we will use echo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Echo does what you think it does. You give it an argument, and bash reads it back to you. While it seems useless using it directly in the terminal, echo is essentially the print statment of Shell. So to write a "Hello World" program, it's quite simple!
    </p>

    <pre><code>
	#! /bin/bash
	echo "Hello World!"
    </code></pre>
